## Inspirational
Originally, this project was supposed to be a public [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) key server because I was frustrated with the current selection of key servers, but I randomly had the idea to make a "chan"-like forum and I had this sitting around so I made this!

## Usage
1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Clone the repository.
3. `$ cargo run`.

Pre-built binaries *might* be available in the future if there is enough demand for them.

## Contribution
Feel free to make pull requests or open issues if you think a feature should be added or you find a bug, or just anything --- within reason.

### Notes
Ignore my messy Handlebars templates, I didn't really have a purpose to make them fancy or whatever because of the simplicity of the project.
